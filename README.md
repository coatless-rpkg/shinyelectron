Turn any Shiny app — R or Python — into a standalone desktop application
that runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux. No web server, no browser tab,
no deployment infrastructure. Just an `.app`, `.exe`, or AppImage your
users double-click to open.

> [!IMPORTANT]

> This package is currently in the prototype/experimental stage. It is
> not yet on CRAN and may have rough edges. **Not recommended for
> production applications at this time.**

## Install

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("coatless-rpkg/shinyelectron")
```

## Quick start

``` r
library(shinyelectron)

# Check your system
sitrep_shinyelectron()

# Try a bundled demo
export(
  appdir  = example_app("r-single"),
  destdir = "~/Desktop/my-first-app",
  run_after = TRUE
)
```

That’s the whole workflow: one call converts your app, wraps it in
Electron, builds a distributable, and launches it. Takes about a minute
for a small app.

## What you can export

| App Type | Runs In | User Needs | Best For |
|----|----|----|----|
| `r-shinylive` | Browser (WebR) | Nothing | Simple R apps |
| `py-shinylive` | Browser (Pyodide) | Nothing | Simple Python apps |
| `r-shiny` | R process | R (or bundled) | Full R package support |
| `py-shiny` | Python process | Python (or bundled) | Full Python package support |

Native types (`r-shiny` / `py-shiny`) support four **runtime
strategies** for delivering R or Python to the end user: `auto-download`
(default), `bundled`, `system`, or `container`. See the [Runtime
Strategies
guide](https://r-pkg.thecoatlessprofessor.com/shinyelectron/articles/runtime-strategies.html)
for the decision matrix.

> [!NOTE]
>
> **Linux note for `r-shiny`:** `bundled` and `auto-download` strategies
> rely on the [portable-r](https://github.com/portable-r) project, which
> currently publishes builds for macOS and Windows only. On Linux, use
> `system` (the user has R installed) or `container` (Docker/Podman).
> Python apps work with all strategies on Linux via
> [python-build-standalone](https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone).

## Prerequisites

These are required on the **build machine** (where you run `export()`).
End users of your packaged app need nothing pre-installed for
`shinylive` types, and only R or Python for native types (unless you use
the `bundled` runtime strategy, which ships the runtime inside the app).

- **R** (\>= 4.4.0)
- **Node.js** (\>= 22.0.0) — run `install_nodejs()` to install locally
  without admin rights
- **npm** (\>= 11.5.0) — included with Node.js

Platform build tools:

| Platform | Requirement                   |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| macOS    | Xcode Command Line Tools      |
| Windows  | Visual Studio Build Tools     |
| Linux    | `build-essential` (gcc, make) |

> [!TIP]
>
> Run `sitrep_shinyelectron()` to verify your system is ready before
> your first export. It checks everything above and tells you what’s
> missing.

## Acknowledgements

Turning Shiny apps into desktop apps is a problem many people have
attacked over the years. shinyelectron stands on the shoulders of prior
packaging attempts, community tutorials, and the broader WebR / Pyodide
/ Electron ecosystems. The list below credits the specific projects
whose approaches directly informed this one; we’re grateful to the much
larger community of contributors experimenting in this space.

### Prior packaging attempts

- [electricShine](https://chasemc.github.io/electricShine/) — R package
  that streamlines distributable Shiny Electron apps via its
  `electrify()` function; automates Windows builds.
- [Photon](https://github.com/COVAIL/photon) — RStudio add-in that
  leverages Electron to build standalone Shiny apps for macOS and
  Windows by cloning an R-specific
  [`electron-quick-start`](https://github.com/COVAIL/electron-quick-start)
  repository and including portable R versions.
- [RInno](https://github.com/ficonsulting/RInno) — standalone R
  application builder with Electron on Windows.
- [DesktopDeployR](https://github.com/wleepang/DesktopDeployR) —
  alternative framework for deploying self-contained R-based
  applications with a portable R environment and private package
  library.

### Talks, tutorials, and templates

- **UseR! 2018** — [Shiny meets
  Electron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARrbbviGvjc) by @ksasso
  demonstrating how to convert Shiny apps into standalone desktop apps.
- **Developer tutorials** — step-by-step guides from
  [@lawalter](https://github.com/lawalter/r-shiny-electron-app) and
  [@dirkschumacher](https://github.com/dirkschumacher/r-shiny-electron)
  on practical integration.
- **Zarathu Corporation templates** — cross-platform deployment
  templates for [macOS
  ARM](https://github.com/zarathucorp/shiny-electron-template-m1) and
  [Windows](https://github.com/zarathucorp/shiny-electron-template-windows),
  summarized in this [R-bloggers
  post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2023/03/creating-standalone-apps-from-shiny-with-electron-2023-macos-m1/).

### Upstream projects

- [Electron](https://electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/application-distribution)
  — the desktop framework.
- [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/) — the packaging
  pipeline that produces platform installers.
- [shinylive](https://github.com/posit-dev/r-shinylive) (Posit) and
  [WebR](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/) — R in WebAssembly, enabling
  browser-only Shiny apps.
- [py-shinylive](https://github.com/posit-dev/py-shinylive) and
  [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/) — the Python equivalents.
- [portable-r](https://github.com/portable-r) — standalone R binaries
  used by the `bundled` and `auto-download` strategies.
- [python-build-standalone](https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone)
  — standalone Python builds used by the Python strategies.
